# FS25_ScriptRepro
This is a Script Repo where I publish all my FS25 Skripts which are allowed to be used as they are.
It is not allowed to use them for other games than the FS25 and it is not allowed to change them in any way. 
There will be permission to change my scripts in any way.
With adding my scripts to your mods or maps you agree in keep them up to date in case of errors in the script from e.g. Giants Patches.
I will not offer support for these scripts to users of mods which have my scrips inside. Only the Modder can request support for them.
But I will not be a teacher to teach beginners of how to build in a script generally in a mod.
Using scripts in mods is for advanced modders.

All scripts will be in a folder with with script name.
Only the newest version of the script will be in.
I try to describe the usage of the script in the script. 
I will give as many as information there an advanved modder will need to use it.
